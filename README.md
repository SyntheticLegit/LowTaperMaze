This is (mostly) the files for the game Low Taper Maze that was created by me. As of today, te 22nd of July 2024, the original files have been lost to time, but the game still remains.
Whatever still remains in this repository remains. There will be no changing.
I will try to find the original game and upload here. You can still play this abombination

Till then, Toodles!
